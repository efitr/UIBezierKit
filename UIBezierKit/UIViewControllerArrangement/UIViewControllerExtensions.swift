     ON the UIViewController, the most we get to work on is the view: UIView!, that is
     in here
     We can make the elements for when you want to build directly on the screen,
     exactly on the instance of view: UIView embedded on UIViewController
     We can position the new view according to the view that is already here, we
     make points out of the dimensions of this view
     Here is for usbviews arrangement on the lower hierarchy view
